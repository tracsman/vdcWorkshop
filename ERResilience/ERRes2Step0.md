# ExpressRoute Resiliency Workshop Part 2 - Cloud Shell Initialization (Step 0)

## Abstract

[Azure Cloud Shell][CloudShell] is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell. We'll be using the Cloud Shell for the deployment of PowerShell scripts to build today's environment. Using the Cloud Shell provides a unified foundation to interact with Azure with all the PowerShell settings and Azure SDKs loaded, so you can start the shell and immediately begin interacting with Azure.

This initialization step (step 0) of the workshop has you start the Cloud Shell, ensure you're using the PowerShell experience, and download the Workshop files.
