# Hands-On ExpressRoute Resiliency Workshop

## Abstract

This lab is comprised of two parts will walk through the steps needed to setup a maximum resiliency configuration and metro deployment for two pre-existing network structures. There are pre-created resources to allow us to get to the heart of the operations without delaying for resources to be built.

## Workshop Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be completed before you start this workshop:

* You must be connected to the internet.

* Use either Edge or Chrome when executing the labs, Internet Explorer may have issues.

* You should have received a pre-assigned workshop number (10 - 50) that you will use to access your resource group.

## Workshop Proposed Agenda

* [Part 1][Part1] - Focuses on ExpressRoute Maximum Resiliency and fail over testing
* [Part 2][Part2] - Focuses on the new metro peering location architecture and migrating from a standard circuit.
