# Hands-On ExpressRoute Resiliency Workshop

## Abstract

This lab is comprised of two parts will walk through the steps needed to setup a maximum resiliency configuration and metro deployment for two pre-existing network structures. There are pre-created resources to allow us to get to the heart of the operations without delaying for resources to be built.
