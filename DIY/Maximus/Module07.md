# DIY Workshop Maximus - Module 7

## Abstract
In this module, we will simulate on-prem and remote user connectivity over VPN. We will create an "on-prem" VNet and connect it to a VPN gateway in the hub over S2S VPN. We will also create a "coffee shop" VNet (remote user) and connect it to the same VPN gateway in the hub over P2S VPN. 

## Observations
Once you're done with this step, you would have learnt to deply P2S and S2S VPN connectivity.

## Deployment
1. While in the Scripts folder run
   ```powershell
   ./Module07.ps1
   ```
   > **NOTE**: You may see “warnings” from PowerShell about upcoming changes in the Azure PowerShell SDK. These warnings do not affect running of the scripts.

2. (Optional) in the editor pane you can select and view the script before running

## Validation
1. xxx
